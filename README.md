# Stream Team

## Introduction

Stream Team is a website that helps you Stream together as a team. This project was a winning submission to Pickhacks 2021. 

Created to eliminate the lengthy indecisive phase of stream as a group, the site allows a user to generate a session link based on the streaming service and genres of choice. Each member in the group can use the link to swipe through a list of movies to mark their preferences. Once everyone has chosen, the site will return a list of movies that everyone can unanimously agree on watching.
